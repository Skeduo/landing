		<h1 class="page-title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
		<p class="faq-question">How long does it take to set up?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">It takes less than 5 minutes to complete your profile, after which all you have to do is wait for a new meeting to be arranged and show up to the meeting. That's all the effort we require from you!</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How much does <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> cost?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer"><span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> is absolutely free. We may roll out new premium features later on, but all the currently-available features will remain free forever.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">Does <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> sell our user data?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">We need to collect a lot of data to feed into our algorithm to make it more relevant for you. But rest assured that your data is safe with us. We will not disclose any data to any third-parties or sell your personal information. We may occasionally use the aggregated data to produce reports and/or whitepapers, but you will never be personally identified.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How does <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> generate money?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">At the moment, we are more focused on building a user base. After that we will integrate our platform with a restaurant-booking platform which will charge the restaurant a low commission, and also give the customers (you guys) a decent discount. So the aim is a win-win-win situation, where the restaurants acquire more customers, our users get a good deal out of their meal, and we make some money.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How does <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> work?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer"><span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> uses a sophisticated algorithm to pair you up with someone else using the app. The algorithm takes your preferences, location, industry and many other factors into account, After a pairing is made, <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> will then send both a notification, with a proposed time, date and location. Both users must then acknowledge the meeting and turn up.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">What happens during a <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> meeting?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer"><span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> sets no agenda and you can talk about whatever you want. However, we would advise on doing a little research on the person you've been paired with, to make your meeting as efficient as possible.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How long is each meeting?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">There's no time limit on the length of the meeting. But so both parties know roughly what to expect, we recommend 45 minutes for coffee, 1 to 1.5 hours for lunches, and 2 to 2.5 hours for dinners. If you have a shorter time frame, just let the other person know.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">Something came up, I can't make the meeting. What should I do?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">When a meeting is arranged, you'll be given the other person's contact details. Contact them immediately telling him/her you can't make it, and try to arrange an alternative date. If you are unable to make contact, give us an email at dan@skeduo.com.</p>

		<p>This will, however, score negatively in our algorithm, so avoid this at all costs. If you keep cancelling meetings, there's a possibility you will be banned.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">What if I am not available this week?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">If you're not available, just toggle the "I'm available" setting on your menu, and we will stop scheduling your meetings immediately, until you switch it back on again. You would still be expected to attend meetings already arranged.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How do I pronounce <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span>?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer"><span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> is pronounced like "schedule". So if you're from the US, this would be [skej-ool], if you're from the UK, it'd be [shed-yool]. Officially, it's /&#712;&#643;edju&#720;l/</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How do you ensure the quality of the users on <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span>?
		<p class="faq-answer">We realized, from the very beginning, that this is one of the most important things to get right, so we have built in these mechanisms into our algorithm:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rating system</li>
			<li>Reputation - This is not a public value users can view, but algorithm will match you up with people of a similar reputation. This means the more you use the app, the more connected you are, the better the quality of the connection.</li>
			<li>We are looking to bring in a verification system where users can verify their real-life identity.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="faq-question">How is this different from your competitor?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">Unlike other professional networking app, <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> encourages users to form a healthy habit of networking regularly, to build up their network over time.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">How does <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> ensure we are compatible?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">Our algorithm takes into account your role, your industry and your preference. We base the pairing on these factors. Of course we can't guarantee every meeting will be life-changing, but we find that as long as you are willing to listen, there's always something to take away in each meeting. And we hope that, in general, <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> brings more than enough value for you to stick around.</p>
		<p>Also, as more users use <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span>, the chances of finding highly-compatible matches increases, so share <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> with your friends!</p>

		<p class="faq-question">Is <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> a dating site for professionals?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">No. We will ban any users who use this app for dating purposes immediately. If you go to meetings with that mindset, you'd be disappointed, so don't do it.</p>

		<p class="faq-question">Who are your target audience?</p>
		<p class="faq-answer">Our vision is to make <span class="appName">SKEDUO</span> the de facto app for professional networking. But big things starts small, so at the moment, we are focusing on these niches:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Entrepreneurs and startups to raise money, or find partners and co-founders</li>
			<li>Venture Capitalists to field credible startups</li>
			<li>Freelancers</li>
			<li>People who work at home</li>
		</ul>
